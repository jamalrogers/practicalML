*Using the Tidymodels package*

### **INTRODUCTION**

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, the goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here:

<br>
(see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

### **OBJECTIVE**
The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which the 6 participants did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set.

<hr>
**Load the Training and Testing Datasets**
```{r}
training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")   #main data for this project.
testing <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")   #will be used to predict 20 observations.
```
```{r}
dim(training)
dim(testing)
```
Both training and tesing datasets have 160 variables.


<br>
**Load the Machine Learning Package**
```{r}
library(tidymodels)
```
<br>
**Load the Tidyverse Package for data visualization**
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
<br>
**Data Cleaning and Wrangling**
```{r}
training <- training[, colSums(is.na(training))==0]
training <- training[, -c(1:7)]
classe <- as.factor(training$classe)
training <- training[,sapply(training, is.numeric)]
training <- data.frame(training, classe)
```
Columns with NA and unwanted(non-numerical) values are removed. The resulting dataset now contains only 53 columns from 160.

<br>
**Response Variable Analysis**
```{r}
ggplot(data=training) +
        geom_bar(mapping=aes(classe, fill=classe))
```
<br>
Classification of 5 classes is shown in the plot above. Classe A higher than the rest of the 4 classes but prediction can proceed due to the high number of observations.


<br>
**Data Preprocessing**
<br>
Training data is split into new training (70%) and testing sets (30%). Preprocessing is done on all predictors removing the variables with large absolute correlations with other variables. The same is done to both the splitted datasets.
```{r}
# Splitting the original training data into new training data and testing sets.
data_split <- initial_split(data=training, prop=0.7)

# Preprocessing
training_recipe <- training(data_split) %>%
        recipe(classe ~.) %>%
        step_corr(all_predictors()) %>%
        prep()
training_recipe

#preprocess testing data
data_testing <- training_recipe %>%
        bake(testing(data_split))

#load training data
data_training <- juice(training_recipe)

```
<br>
**Model Training using Random Forest**
<br>
The prediction algorithm of choice is the random forest for classification. 
```{r}
data_rf <- rand_forest(trees = 100, mode="classification") %>%
        set_engine("randomForest") %>%
        fit(classe ~., data=data_training)
data_rf
```
As shown, 100 tress are used and 6 variable are tried in each split. The Out Of Bag estimate error rate is very small at 0.76%. A confusion matrix is shown above.

<br>
**Prediction**
<br>
The predict() command is used for prediction. Arguments include the model and the splitted testing dataset.
```{r}
predict(data_rf, data_testing)
```
<br>
**Validation**
<br>
Validation is done using the metrics() function where the truth argument corresponds to the response variable class and the estimate argument correspond to the predicted values. This step outputs the accuracy and kappa metrics as shown.
```{r}
data_rf %>%
        predict(data_testing) %>%
        bind_cols(data_testing) %>%
        metrics(truth=classe, estimate=.pred_class)
```


<br>
**THE MODEL IS 99% ACCURATE**


<br>
**Predicting the testing dataset**
<br>
Using the original testing dataset, a prediction is done to produce 20 predicted values.
```{r}
predict(data_rf, testing)
```
